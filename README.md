To run this project, you have to do two things.

  1. First you need to download the test section of Newsroom dataset ("test.jsonl") and place it in the "dataloader" folder.
  
     link to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQTZBdULnxJ45pvteymvg-YG0e_sPRqX/view
     
     We could not automate this portion using gdown or curl.
 
 2. Second, you just need to execute "run_me.sh"

You will get the results in the "results" folder.

The results we got after executing the file is presented in "our_results" folder. Only a subset of these results are added to the presentation due to space and time constraint. We finished the project completely and presented on December 6, 2022.
